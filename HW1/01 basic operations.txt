Task 1 
 
Create 3 variables x = 6, y = 15, and z = 4:
Perform and display the results of the following operations for these variables:
· x += y - x++ * z ; 
· z = -- x - y * 5 ; 
· y /= x + 5 % z ;  
· z = x++ + y * 5 ; 
· x = y - x++ * z ; 
Note: for each operation please use default values: x = 6, y = 15, and z = 4
 
Task 2 
 
Calculate the arithmetic average value of the three integer values and display it on the screen.
 
Task 3 
 
Write a program for calculating the volume - V and the surface area - S of the cylinder.
The volume V of the cylinder of radius-r and height-h, is calculated by the formula: V = πr 2 h.
The area S of the surface of the cylinder is calculated by the formula: S = 2π rh + 2π r 2 = 2π r (r + h). 
The results of calculations should be displayed on the screen.
